  <p class="palabras"> If the title is not clear enough for you, well<br>
  my name is Arely, and I am 15 years old. I am currently a first year SMASH scholar<br>
  with quite a lot of enthusiasm. I try to maintain my positive<br>
  attitude as much as I can. I consider myself mature at mind,<br>
  but childish at energy, only sometimes.</p>

  <p class="dos"> My favorite color is green, and the best food in the<br>
    whole world would have to be enchiladas or chiles rellenos.<br>
    Math is honestly one of my favorite subjects,where it can all<br>
    be very satisfying. Ironically though, I enjoy reading. I feel<br>
    like I go somewhere else when I read. I am the middle of<br>
    5 siblings, and I am just a chicana trying to get
    around.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p></div>

  <p class="over"> I enjoy reading poetry and a genre<br>
        of poetry I enjoy is those old classic poems <br>
        such as poems by Shakespeare and Pablo Neruda.<br>
        I feel like I enjoy these poems because they are<br>
        corny, so here goes a poem by Skakespeare named<br>
        Sonnet 130:<br>
      </div>
  <p class="sonnet130">
        My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
   As any she belied with false compare.</p>
